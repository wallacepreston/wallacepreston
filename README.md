## Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Preston
#### I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer (and All-Around Nice Guy)
Check out my profile site: [prestonwallace.com](https://prestonwallace.com/) or my [List of Demo Apps](https://github.com/wallacepreston/example-tech) demonstrating the tech I like working in.

I'm Preston Wallace. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with a longstanding love for everything tech. I currently work as a Backend Software Engineer at MNTN in what I absolutely love: Node.js and GraphQL on the backend. In my day-to-day job, I build backend solutions (mostly GraphQL) that work with SQL databases (PostgreSQL, Sequelize) to efficiently manage datasets with records on the order of millions. On the frontend, I create reusable components that can efficiently display and interact with this data for the company's web applications. At night, I am a Software Engineering Instructor at Fullstack Academy, teaching React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL.
