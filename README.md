## Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Preston
#### I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer (and All-Around Nice Guy)
Check out my profile site: [prestonwallace.com](https://prestonwallace.com/)

I have a longstanding love for everything tech. I currently work as a Full-Stack Software Engineer in what I absolutely love: Node.js on the backend, and frameworks such as React and Vue on the frontend. In my day-to-day job, I build backend solutions that work with SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) to manage datasets with records on the order of millions. On the frontend, I create reusable components that can efficiently display and interact with this data for the company's web applications. At night, I am a Software Engineering Instructor at Fullstack Academy, teaching React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL.
